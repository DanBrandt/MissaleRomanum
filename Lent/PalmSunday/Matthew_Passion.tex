{\color{red} The Gospel procession having taken place, the clerics assemble themselves on the Gospel side, facing liturgical north. The Passion Narrative is chanted, with \textit{four} parts contributing: The Chronicler (symbolized by a letter `\textit{C}'), Christ (symbolized by a \maltese), a singular Synagogue part (symbolized by a `\textit{S}'), and a plural Synagogue part, known as the `Turba', literally meaning `crowd' (symbolized by a `\textit{T}').  The Chronicler begins the chanting of the Passion narrative.}
